DeFiOneV1Pool : contracts/contracts/DeFiOneV1Pool.sol

 --- 
### Modifiers:
### lock

```solidity
modifier lock()
```

_Mutually exclusive reentrancy protection into the pool to/from a method. This method also prevents entrance
to a function before the pool is initialized. The reentrancy guard is required throughout the contract because
we use balance checks to determine the payment status of interactions such as mint, swap and flash._

### onlyFactoryOwner

```solidity
modifier onlyFactoryOwner()
```

_Prevents calling a function from anyone except the address returned by IDeFiOneV1Factory#owner()_

 --- 
### Functions:
### constructor

```solidity
constructor() public
```

### _blockTimestamp

```solidity
function _blockTimestamp() internal view virtual returns (uint32)
```

_Returns the block timestamp truncated to 32 bits, i.e. mod 2**32. This method is overridden in tests._

### snapshotCumulativesInside

```solidity
function snapshotCumulativesInside(int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper) external view returns (int56 tickCumulativeInside, uint160 secondsPerLiquidityInsideX128, uint32 secondsInside)
```

Returns a snapshot of the tick cumulative, seconds per liquidity and seconds inside a tick range

_Snapshots must only be compared to other snapshots, taken over a period for which a position existed.
I.e., snapshots cannot be compared if a position is not held for the entire period between when the first
snapshot is taken and the second snapshot is taken._

#### Parameters

```

Returns the cumulative tick and liquidity as of each timestamp `secondsAgo` from the current block timestamp

_To get a time weighted average tick or liquidity-in-range, you must call this with two values, one representing
the beginning of the period and another for the end of the period. E.g., to get the last hour time-weighted average tick,
you must call it with secondsAgos = [3600, 0].
The time weighted average tick represents the geometric time weighted average price of the pool, in
log base sqrt(1.0001) of token1 / token0. The TickMath library can be used to go from a tick value to a ratio._

function getNextSqrtPriceFromAmount0RoundingUp(uint160 sqrtPX96, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount, bool add) internal pure returns (uint160)
```

Gets the next sqrt price given a delta of token0

_Always rounds up, because in the exact output case (increasing price) we need to move the price at least
far enough to get the desired output amount, and in the exact input case (decreasing price) we need to move the
price less in order to not send too much output.
The most precise formula for this is liquidity * sqrtPX96 / (liquidity +- amount * sqrtPX96),
if this is impossible because of overflow, we calculate liquidity / (liquidity / sqrtPX96 +- amount)._

_Always rounds down, because in the exact output case (decreasing price) we need to move the price at least
far enough to get the desired output amount, and in the exact input case (increasing price) we need to move the
price less in order to not send too much output.
The formula we compute is within $\lt$1 wei of the lossless version: sqrtPX96 +- amount / liquidity_
